Go from a fresh Windows install to a fully configured dev box in one command. These CI-tested setups install your tools, settings, and shells the same way every time — so any machine can be your machine in minutes.

## 🎯 Pick your setup

Three developer setups live in this repo. Pick the one that matches what you want:

| You want... | Go to |
| --- | --- |
| A complete dev workstation: tools, OS settings, WSL, and terminal. One command, restarts once. | [Windows Dev Config](#%EF%B8%8F-windows-dev-config) |
| A polished WSL shell: zsh/bash, Starship, CLI tools, and a themed terminal profile. Interactive or unattended. | [WSL Comfort](#-wsl-comfort) |
| A single language toolchain: Node, Python, SQL, PowerShell, .NET, Rust, Go, Java, PHP, WinForms, or WinUI 3. One command each. | [Workloads](#-single-language-workloads) |

Most of the single-language workloads use [`winget configure`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/configure). If you've never used it before, enable it once:

```powershell
winget configure --enable
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If `winget` is being invoked from a **non-elevated** environment, the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable ([aka.ms/vcredist](https://aka.ms/vcredist)) must also be installed — without it `winget configure` fails with an internal error. Install it once with the command for your machine's architecture:
>
> ```powershell
> # x64:
> winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64
>
> # ARM64:
> winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.arm64
> ```

If that fails or `winget configure` is still not recognized, see [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting). Windows Dev Config doesn't use `winget configure` and needs none of this.

## 🖥️ Windows Dev Config

*Turns a fresh Windows 11 box into a clean, distraction-free dev workstation in one shot.*

A set of PowerShell scripts that installs dev tools, applies opinionated Windows settings, and sets up WSL + Ubuntu through the required reboot. Nothing to clone, nothing to install first. Idempotent, so it's safe to re-run on an existing machine.

Open any PowerShell window — elevated or not — and run:

```powershell
$url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/WindowsDeveloperConfig/main/src/windows-dev-config/bootstrap.ps1'
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm $url))) -AllowUnsigned
```

If you're not already elevated, setup requests UAC consent before starting. It requests consent again when resuming after a reboot. Expect about 30 minutes on a clean machine.

> `-AllowUnsigned` runs the source copy under `src/` instead of the signed copy at the repository root.

> ⚠️ **It will restart your machine, once.** Enabling WSL needs a Windows optional feature that requires a restart. You get a 10-second warning, and a scheduled task resumes setup after you sign back in and accept the UAC prompt. **Save your work before you start.**

<details>
<summary><strong>What you get</strong></summary>

- **Dev tools:** Windows Terminal, PowerShell 7, Git, GitHub CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, VS Code, and Coreutils for Windows. Language runtimes, SDKs, prompts, PowerToys, and Windows App CLI are intentionally left to your Dev Container or other project-specific tooling.
- **Terminal:** PowerShell 7 as the default profile, Cascadia Mono NF as the default font, and a GitHub Copilot profile in the dropdown.
- **Windows settings:** Dark theme, Developer Mode, Sudo, long paths, File Explorer defaults, Start/Search cleanup, Do Not Disturb, widgets off, and Edge policies.
- **WSL:** WSL platform + Ubuntu, including the restart and the automatic resume afterwards.

## 🐧 WSL Comfort

*Also known as Comfort Shell. An interactive setup for a polished Windows + WSL shell environment.*

WSL Comfort stands apart. It supports both interactive and non-interactive modes, and lets you pick and choose individual components. The Windows side handles WSL, the distro, the Cascadia Code Nerd Font, and a themed Windows Terminal profile. The Linux side runs inside the distro and configures the shell itself.

```powershell
.\wsl-comfort\install.ps1
```

Interactive by default. Use `-NonInteractive` for unattended runs; the bootstrap also takes `--minimal` for a smaller setup. The Linux half is standalone, so you can copy `comfort-shell-bootstrap.sh` onto any Ubuntu host and run it directly.

<details>
<summary><strong>What you can pick</strong></summary>

- Your choice of shell: **zsh** or **bash**.
- Optional **Starship** prompt.
- Optional modern CLI tools: `fzf`, `rg`, `fd`, `bat`, `eza`, `zoxide`, `jq`.
- Optional clipboard and `open` shims (`pbcopy`, `pbpaste`, `open`).
- Optional **Homebrew**.
- Optional Git defaults.
- A themed **Windows Terminal** profile using Cascadia Code Nerd Font.

## 🧪 Single-language workloads

Just want one toolchain? Pick a row. Each workload ships a `configuration.winget` file plus a matching `install.ps1` shim that applies it and refreshes PATH in the current session.

| Workload   | Installs                                                                | Run                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TypeScript | Node.js LTS + global `typescript`                                       | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\typescript\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity` |
| PHP        | PHP 8.5                                                                 | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\php\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity`        |
| .NET       | .NET SDK 10                                                             | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\dotnet\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity`     |
| Go         | Go (rolling)                                                            | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\go\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity`         |
| Java       | Microsoft Build of OpenJDK 25 LTS                                       | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\java\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity`       |
| Rust       | Rust stable via rustup                                                  | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\rust\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity`       |
| Python     | Python 3.14 + uv                                                       | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\python\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity`     |
| SQL        | Lightweight SQL Developer: SQL Server + sqlcmd + VS Code extension     | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\sql\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity`        |
| PowerShell | PowerShell 7 + VS Code PowerShell extensions + PSScriptAnalyzer settings | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\powershell\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity` |
| WinForms   | .NET SDK 10 + Windows Forms desktop workload                            | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\winforms\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity`   |
| WinAppCLI  | Developer Mode + .NET SDK 10 + Windows App Development CLI             | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\winappcli\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity` |
| WinUI 3    | .NET SDK 10 + Visual Studio Community + Windows App SDK / WinUI 3 + WinAppCLI | `winget configure -f .\Workloads\winui\configuration.winget --accept-configuration-agreements --disable-interactivity` |

Want the PATH refresh in your current shell? Use the matching shim instead of calling `winget configure` directly:

```powershell
.\Workloads\python\install.ps1
```

> **Heads up:** WinForms and WinUI 3 pull down several gigabytes of Visual Studio components. Fine on a real workstation, painful on a small VM.

## 🎨 Command Palette extension (coming soon)

A [PowerToys Command Palette](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/powertoys/command-palette/overview) extension lives under [`src/future/cmdpal/`](./src/future/cmdpal/). It reads the same flow list as the rest of the repo and surfaces every flow as a launchable entry, so you don't have to remember which `configuration.winget` to point `winget` at.

See [`src/future/cmdpal/README.md`](./src/future/cmdpal/README.md) for build and install instructions.

<br/>

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>"Unrecognized command: configure"</strong></summary>

Run `winget configure --enable`. If `winget configure` is still not recognized after that, [`Workloads/_common/assert-winget-configure.ps1`](./Workloads/_common/assert-winget-configure.ps1) tells you whether App Installer is too old, policy has disabled configuration, or something else needs fixing.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><code>winget configure</code> fails with "internal error" / error code <code>-2146233079</code></strong></summary>

This usually means the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is missing — `winget configure` depends on it when invoked from a non-elevated environment. Install it once with the command for your architecture, then re-run:

```powershell
# x64:
winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64

# ARM64:
winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.arm64
```

See [aka.ms/vcredist](https://aka.ms/vcredist) for the standalone installer. The repo's [`Workloads/_common/enable-winget-configure.ps1`](./Workloads/_common/enable-winget-configure.ps1) script also installs it automatically as part of enabling `winget configure`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A workload says it succeeded but <code>python</code> / <code>node</code> / the tool isn't on PATH</strong></summary>

Open a new terminal, or run the matching `install.ps1` shim to refresh PATH in the current session.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows Dev Config rebooted the machine and looks stuck</strong></summary>

It registered a scheduled task named `WindowsDevConfigResume`, so the run picks itself back up about 30 seconds after you sign back in. A window opens on its own and finishes the WSL setup. If nothing appears after a couple of minutes, run the one-liner again — it's safe to re-run and skips everything already done. More detail in [`windows-dev-config/README.md`](./src/windows-dev-config/README.md#troubleshooting).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Comfort Shell bootstrap fails because WSL is missing</strong></summary>

Run `.\wsl-comfort\install.ps1` on the Windows side instead. It installs WSL first.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>WSL install fails with <code>wsl --install ... failed with exit code -1</code></strong></summary>

WSL needs hardware virtualization available to the OS. Two common root causes:

- **On bare metal:** virtualization (VT-x / AMD-V) is disabled in BIOS/UEFI. Reboot into firmware settings, enable it, save, and reboot back into Windows. The exact label varies by vendor — check your motherboard or laptop manufacturer's documentation if you can't find it.
- **Inside a VM:** the host hasn't exposed nested virtualization to the guest. For a Hyper-V host, run this from an elevated PowerShell session **on the host** (with the guest VM powered off):

  ```powershell
  Set-VMProcessor -VMName <VM_NAME> -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true
  ```

  Other hypervisors have their own equivalent settings — check your hypervisor's documentation.

## ❤️ Contributing

Contributions of all kinds are welcome: bug reports, doc fixes, new workloads, voice-and-tone tweaks. Start with [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md), then read [`src/docs/development.md`](./src/docs/development.md) for the CI matrix, the "how to add a language" walkthrough, and how the sign pipeline works.

> **Note on the repo layout:** the [`src/`](./src/) tree is the source of truth. The top-level `windows-dev-config/`, `Workloads/`, and `wsl-comfort/` folders are Authenticode-signed release copies regenerated by the sign pipeline, so please don't edit them directly. Full details in [`src/docs/development.md`](./src/docs/development.md#repo-layout-signed-vs-source).

The single source of truth for every flow (paths, build/run commands, ids, language metadata) is [`src/manifest.yml`](./src/manifest.yml). The Command Palette extension, the CI harness, and the per-flow shims all read from it, so keep it in sync when you add or rename a flow.
